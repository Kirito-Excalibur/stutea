            At stutea we believe in making every learner a teacher. That is
            exactly what our name signifies! Stu-dent + tea-cher.

            We a group of college students came up with the idea of providing
            students with a platform wherein they can post their doubts and
            solve other studentsâ€™ doubts. This concept would result in quicker
            doubt resolution along with simple solutions because the student
            solving doubts will be having similar knowledge and resources!
